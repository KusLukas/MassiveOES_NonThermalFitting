Just a few basic operations with massiveOES focused on analysis of SPS and FNS (N2). The jupyter notebook introduces thermal, nontherma fitting, seperation of simulations and boltzman plots. 

Acces by typing `jupyter notebook` in any higher level folder and selecting the referenced file. For more specific cases feel free to cantact me at lkusyn@mail.muni.cz, I have dozens of case-specific scripts to processes thermal and non-equilibrium spectra.
